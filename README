Subtitle grabber for SickBeard
==============================

Use case
--------

You use SickBeard [http://sickbeard.com/] but you need subtitle support because
SickBeard only download english episodes and your girlfriend is not that
comfortable with English.

Requirements
------------

A working SickBeard installation.
Pip : sudo apt-get install python-pip on Debian
PYTHONPATH containing the absolute pat to SickBeard. For instance if SickBeard
is installed in /home/foo/SickBeard, echo $PYTHONPATH should show that path. If
not just run export PYTHONPATH=/home/foo/SickBeard:$PYTHONPATH

.. Note:::

    Exporting PYTHONPATH did not work for me, I had to force the path directly
    from the python code. If you need to force it too, simply change the
    following line in fetchsubtitles.py and adapt the path to your system:

        sys.path.append('/home/jerome/Sick-Beard')

Installation
------------

- Clone this repository on your system.
- sudo pip install -r pythonrequirements.txt
- stop SickBeard
- Open /path/to/your/SickBeard/installation/config.ini
- Locate the extra_scripts line and configure it like this: ::

    extra_scripts = /absolute/path/to/python /absolute/path/to/fetchsubtitles.py fr

- Start SickBeard

That should be it.

Only french subtitles are supported for now.
